  <h4><u><strong>The Problem</strong></u></h4>
    <p>
    	Far too often, job applications are treated as if they were sent into a black hole. They send something in and hope something comes out the other side. Waiting for a response, if you get one at all, can be anxiety inducing because there isn't a way to get a good estimate of when you'll ever hear back. 
    </p>

  <h4><u><strong>The Solution</strong></u></h4>
    <p>
    	Rely-Apply was created to deal with the problem of not having a good estimate of when you'll hear back from a company. Here on Rely-Apply, users can gather to submit companies and their share their experiences with others to give them an idea of how long it would take for a company to respond to their application. 

    	<div>
 		  <u><strong>Rely-Apply:</strong></u>
 		</div>
 		<div>
 		 <ul>
 			<li>Gives estimated time frames of when a company will get   back to you (which can either be a follow-up interview or a rejection)</li>

 			<li>Reduces anxiety by having this time frame in mind.</li> 

 			<li>Allow job seekers to prioritize which applications they will most likely here back from.</li>

 			<li>Allow job seekers to know when to perform their own follow-up based on the information found on Rely-Apply.
