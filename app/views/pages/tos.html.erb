You may permit us to share information in your Profile with prospective employers, recruiters, and others.

While we provide the option for RelyApply reviewers to specify the category of their employment when they leave a review (e.g contractor, freelancer, etc.), we do not consider this a requirement. It does not violate our Community Guidelines or these Terms for a worker in any one of these roles to leave a review as an "employee."

	These Terms and any and all claims, disputes, or other legal proceedings by or between you or us, including but not limited to any such claims or disputes that are in any way related to or arising under these Terms or your access to or use of RelyApply, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws principles that may otherwise provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. The parties agree that their arrangement under these Terms is in interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act applies to the construction of the "Agreement to Arbitrate" provision below. For any claim, dispute, or other legal proceeding not subject to the "Agreement to Arbitrate" provision below, the claim or dispute shall be brought and litigated exclusively in the state courts located within Marin County, California or the federal courts in the Northern District of California, as appropriate, and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of each of these courts for the purpose of litigating such claims or disputes.
	Agreement to Arbitrate. If you reside in the United States, subject to the Exceptions to Arbitration set forth below, you and RelyApply each agree that any and all disputes between consumer users of RelyApply and RelyApply arising under or related in any way to these Terms and such users' use of RelyApply must be resolved through binding arbitration as described in this section. With the exception of the prohibition on class arbitrations set forth in this "Dispute Resolution" section, if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate will still apply.
	Exceptions to Arbitration. This Agreement to Arbitrate will not apply to the following: (a) small claims court cases that qualify; (b) legal proceedings that involve efforts to obtain user-identifying information; (c) any legal proceedings brought against any of the RelyApply Group by companies or other legal entities; or individuals acting on behalf of such companies or other legal entities; (d) any legal proceedings brought by any of the RelyApply Group against companies or other legal entities or individuals acting on behalf of any such companies or other legal entities; and (e) a party's right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. If, for some reason, the prohibition on class arbitrations set forth in this Dispute Resolution section cannot be enforced, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate will not apply. Where this Agreement to Arbitrate does not apply, the remainder of this Agreement and the Dispute Resolution section will continue to apply.

	Informal Dispute Resolution. 
	If either of us intends to seek arbitration under the agreement, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating arbitration. Notice to RelyApply should be sent to the Litigation Department, RelyApply Inc., 100 Shoreline Highway, Mill Valley, CA 94941. If you have an account on RelyApply, notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your account.

If RelyApply and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or RelyApply may commence formal proceeding.

	Arbitration Procedure. 
	The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), if applicable, as modified by this section. The AAA's rules and a form for initiating the proceeding are available at www.adr.org. Any settlement offer made by you or RelyApply shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. Unless otherwise required by the applicable arbitration rules, the arbitration shall be held in San Francisco, California. For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, you and RelyApply may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and RelyApply subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you or RelyApply may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same RelyApply user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

	Opt-Out Procedure. 
	IF YOU ARE A NEW RelyApply USER, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ("OPT-OUT") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE ("OPT-OUT NOTICE"). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THE RelyApply TERMS OF USE FOR THIS FIRST TIME. YOU MUST MAIL THE OPT-OUT NOTICE TO RelyApply INC, ATTN: LITIGATION DEPARTMENT, RE: OPT-OUT NOTICE, 100 SHORELINE HIGHWAY, MILL VALLEY, CALIFORNIA 94941.

Opting out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.

	Changes to the Agreement to Arbitrate. 
	Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any changes to this "Arbitration" section (other than a change to any referenced notice address or site link) in the future, that change will not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding prior to the effective date of the change. The change will apply to all other disputes or claims governed by this Arbitration section that have arisen or may arise between you and RelyApply. We will notify you of changes to this Arbitration section by posting the changes on RelyApply at least 30 days before the effective date of the changes and by email. If you do not agree to these changed terms, you may close your account within the 30 day period and you will not be bound by the changes.

	Other
	Except as specifically stated in another agreement we have with you, these Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of RelyApply and these Terms supersede all prior proposals, negotiations, agreements, and understandings concerning the subject matter of these Terms. You represent and warrant that no person has made any promise, representation, or warranty, whether express or implied, not contained herein to induce you to enter into this agreement. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, then only that provision shall be modified to reflect the parties' intention or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. To the extent allowed by law, the English version of these Terms are binding and the translations are provided for convenience only. The Terms, and any rights or obligations hereunder, are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with RelyApply's prior written consent, but may be assigned or transferred by us without restriction. Any attempted assignment by you shall violate these Terms and be void. The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect; as used in the Terms, the word "including" means "including but not limited to."
